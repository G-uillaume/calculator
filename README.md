# calculator

This project was developed as part of my training at BeCode.
It was simply a matter of recreating the operation of a calculator using the knowledge we had in JavaScript.
Even if the calculator works, it is still perfectible and will be improved over time.

The keyboard can be used to activate the keys, here are the keys corresponding to the complex functions, the others correspond to the usual keyboard keys :
- Inv => I
- x! => X
- sin => S
- ln => N
- cos => C
- log => L
- tan => T
- âˆš => V
- DEL => Backspace
- = => Enter

## Languages

- JavaScript
- CSS
